##Project Title: 
Revolutionizing Cash on Delivery Payments Through QR Payments
##Project Summary: 
In 2023, Pakistan's e-commerce market ranked 46th globally with a revenue of $5.2 billion. Industry reports indicate that 95% of e-companies rely on cash-on-delivery (COD) for payments, which increases liquidity requirements and operational costs due to the need for dedicated cash management teams. To address these challenges, we propose the "Digital Drop Application" designed to revolutionize COD by enhancing convenience, security, and efficiency. This app will enable seamless integration between e-commerce platforms, courier companies, mobile banking, and customers, allowing COD payments via QR codes for a modern and user-friendly solution.
##Novelty of the Project: 
The "Digital Drop Application" introduces a novel approach to transforming the prevalent cash-on-delivery (COD) system in Pakistan's e-commerce sector. By leveraging QR code technology, the app modernizes the payment process, reducing the dependency on cash handling and minimizing the associated risks and costs. Unlike traditional COD methods that require substantial liquidity and dedicated cash management teams, our solution streamlines transactions, ensuring secure and efficient payments. This innovative integration of e-commerce platforms, courier services, mobile banking, and customers creates a cohesive ecosystem that simplifies the payment experience, ultimately fostering greater trust and convenience for all stakeholders involved.

##Results:
 

When a customer places an order, the merchant can use the app to generate a shipping label that includes all necessary information for the courier booking, such as the delivery address and package details. This shipping label also features a unique QR code that links to the COD payment details (Merchant JazzCash Account & amount of parcel). The shipping label is then printed and affixed to the parcel for delivery. Upon delivery, the customer simply scans the QR code using their mobile banking app to complete the payment.

###Usage Instructions:
Here's how it works:
1.	**Create Accounts**: Sellers create a JazzCash account and link it to our platform, along with their courier company account.

2.	**Order Processing**: When a customer places an order, our platform fetches the order details and shipping information, sending it to the courier company.

3.	**QR Code Generation**: We generate a dynamic QR code with the order amount and expiry, provided by JazzCash. This QR code is included on the shipping label, which the seller attaches to the package.

4.	**Customer Payment**: Upon delivery, the customer scans the QR code using any banking application, making a direct payment to the merchant.

5.	**Payment Confirmation**: Our platform confirms the payment with JazzCash and updates the courier company.

6.	**Post-Delivery Reports**: After delivery, our platform provides settlement reports to both the courier company and the e-commerce merchant, ensuring complete transparency and efficiency.
